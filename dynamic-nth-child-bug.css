The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` can lead to unexpected results when dealing with dynamically added or removed elements. For instance, consider a scenario where elements are added to a list after the page has loaded. The `:nth-child` selector will not accurately target the new elements since it only evaluates the initial set of children.  This is because the selector is evaluated only once when the page is first rendered.
